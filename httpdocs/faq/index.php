                        <h1>FAQ about Tile</h1>
                        <h2>How do I know how much tile I need for my room(s)?</h2>
                        <p><br />

                        <h3>How do I measure my area to tile?</h3>
                        <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Coming Soon...</a><br />
                            Coming Soon...</p>				

                        <h2>What are the differences in tile types?</h2>
                        <p><br />

                        <h3>What is the difference between wall and floor tile?</h3>

                        <h2>How do I know how much setting materials to get? Ie, grout and thinset.</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            That would depend on the tile size and the notch trowel size you are using. The bigger the tile, the bigger the notch trowel you will need, which leads to more thinset needed.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Does my stone need to be sealed?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            Yes. Any natural stone MUST be sealed.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What does the tile rating system mean?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            The tile rating system is related to the finish on the tile. How strong it is, and how long that finish will last. Start at 1, and goes up to 5.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Can I tile over existing tile?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            While tiling over old tile is not recommended, with the proper thinset and floor prep, it can be done.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Can I tile over a painted floor or wall?</h3>
                        <p><br />
                            Backsplash painted wall, yes. However with a painted floor, this is NEVER recommended.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How do you know a tile is safe for wet areas? </h2>
                        <p><br />
                            A non-porous or glazed tile is safe for wet areas. Porous tiles are safe for wet areas ONLY if sealed properly.
                        </p>

                        <h2>How small of a grout joint can I do?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            On a wall, you can go as close as 1/16th of an inch and some tiles are even self-spacing for walls. 
                           <br />
                            For floors, it is never recommended less than an 1/8th of an inch unless a proper mud set is used, and the tile MUST be rectified.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What is a thru body porcelain?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            "Thru body porcelain" is where the color runs through the tile. 
                           <br />
                            It represents a very small portion of porcelain tiles (approximately less than 5%). Most porcelain tiles are GLAZED (like ceramic).
                        </p>

                        <h2>Should I seal my grout, and how long after installation can I safely seal it?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            Grout needs a proper drying tile. We at Your Business Name  recommend 7 to 10 days before sealing.
                        </p>                

                        <h2>Can I install the tile myself?</h2>
                        <p><br />
                            Does a cow say, "Moo"? 
                           <br />
                            With the proper tools and an adequate amount of time allotted for learning new tricks, anything is possible. If you're a Do It Yourself kind of a person or family, there are adequate resources available online or at your local bookstore. 
                           <br />
                            If you are not good with power tools or don not have a lot of patience, you might want to seek a professional to do your installation.
